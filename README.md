## Introduction

This README describes the R script **run_analysis.R** which is used to arrange mobile phone
data into a tidy dataset. 

The main files referred to in this README are:

* The CodeBook file
* run_analysis.R file
* Output tidy data file

all of which can be found on the github repository

List of subsections of this README:  

0. Downloading, unzipping and loading the raw data
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labelling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Writing the tidy data sets from steps 4 and 5 to files
7. code to show how to load the tidy data files from files into R

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
